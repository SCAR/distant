To suggest a new data set, please attach the raw files to this issue or email them separately to `scar.egabi` `at` `gmail.com`. Please also fill out the metadata fields below. The purpose of this metadata is to allow users to quickly filter the collection and identify data sets likely to be suitable for their needs. We are not duplicating all of the metadata and background information provided by the primary publication associated with the data set: we expect that users will consult that reference material directly.

**Taxonomic groups covered**
Enter the taxonomic groups, including species names if applicable.

**Input data type**
e.g. "animal tracking", "net trawls", "human observation"

**Modelling method**
A brief note on the modelling method used, e.g. "MaxEnt", "boosted regression tree", "random forest", "generalized additive model".

**Type of output**
e.g. "probability of presence", "abundance"

**Model performance score and the measure used**
This is helpful to give users some indication of the accuracy/reliability of the outputs. e.g. "AUC 0.95", "deviance explained 0.677"

**Uncertainty type**
e.g. "Not provided" if no estimates of uncertainty have been provided, "CV" for cross-validation.

**Code URL**
URL to a repository holding code used to generate or otherwise related to this data set, if applicable.

**Usage notes**
Notes on usage that are not obvious from the primary publication.

**Primary publication**
The journal paper or other publication describing this data set.

**License governing the use of the data set**
E.g. "CC-BY 4.0". If there is no explicit license given, put "Please cite" as a reminder to users that they should be citing all data sources used.
